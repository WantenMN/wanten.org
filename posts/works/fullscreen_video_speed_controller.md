## Overview

**[Fullscreen Video Speed Controller](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/536243)** is a lightweight and intuitive userscript that enhances your video playback experience. It provides seamless control over playback speed, audio-video synchronization, and quick seeking for fullscreen videos across the web.

## How to Use

1. Open a video in fullscreen mode on any website.
2. Use the following hotkeys to control playback:

   - `j` – Reset speed to 1.0x.
   - `k` – Speed up to 2.0x.
   - `l` – Speed up to 3.0x.
   - `h` – Rewind 5 seconds.
   - `;` – Fast-forward 5 seconds.
   - `i` – Fix A/V sync issues (micro seek).

## Notes

- This script only works in fullscreen mode.
- There may be key conflicts with browser extensions like Vimium. Please disable conflicting extensions and try again.
