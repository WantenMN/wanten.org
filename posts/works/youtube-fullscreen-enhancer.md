This script enhances the user experience when pausing a YouTube video in full-screen mode by hiding certain elements and adding a play icon.

## Links

- [Script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/460569)
- [Code](https://github.com/WantenMN/youtube-fullscreen-enhancer)

## Features

- **Hide Video Title**: The video title is hidden when the video is paused in full-screen mode.
- **Hide Player Control Bar**: The player control bar is hidden when the video is paused in full-screen mode.
- **Stabilize Captions**: Prevents captions text from jumping up and down when you pause or resume the video using the spacebar or "K" key.
- **Add Play Icon**: A play icon is added at the bottom right corner of the video when paused.

## Screenshots

The first screenshot displays the enhanced full-screen mode with hidden interface elements, including the video title and player control bar. Additionally, an overlay of a play icon is added when the video is paused. In contrast, the second screenshot shows the default full-screen mode without the enhancements enabled.
